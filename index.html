            <h2>About TCLP Community Priority Map</h2>
            <p>The Chisholm Legacy Project (TCLP) developed this prioritized list of communities as part of our ongoing effort to address systemic environmental injustice and climate vulnerability across the United States.</p>
            <p>Each community was assessed and ranked based on a combination of environmental, infrastructure, economic, social, and governance-related indicators.</p>
            <p><strong>Priority Tiers:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Critical:</strong> Severe and immediate threats requiring urgent intervention</li>
                <li><strong>High:</strong> Significant challenges with multiple compounding issues</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate:</strong> Important concerns requiring sustained attention</li>
                <li><strong>Low:</strong> Communities with manageable challenges</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These include, but are not limited to: contaminated water, flooding, inadequate drainage, food deserts, poor infrastructure, high utility costs, health impacts from pollution, and limited access to public services.</p>
            <p>This prioritization informs our field organizing, resource allocation, and partnership strategies, ensuring that the most vulnerable communities receive timely and sustained support.</p>
